# ERC20 Token Contract in Yul

## Overview

This project implements a standard ERC20 token contract using Yul, the intermediate language for Ethereum. Yul provides low-level control over EVM operations, allowing for gas-efficient implementations of smart contracts.

## Features

- Fully compliant with the ERC20 standard
- Implemented entirely in Yul for maximum gas efficiency
- Includes all standard ERC20 functions:
  - `totalSupply()`
  - `balanceOf(address)`
  - `transfer(address, uint256)`
  - `allowance(address, address)`
  - `approve(address, uint256)`
  - `transferFrom(address, address, uint256)`
- Emits standard ERC20 events:
  - `Transfer`
  - `Approval`

## Contract Details

- Token Name: VVV
- Token Symbol: VV
- Decimals: 18
- Contract Address : 0xaa07dBfBB393333dE274B4Fd31aA9773AcA91Afa

## Usage

To use this contract:

1. Interact with the contract using standard ERC20 methods through a wallet, dApp, or another smart contract.

## Security Considerations

- This contract has been implemented in low-level Yul code. Ensure thorough auditing and testing before use in production.
- Yul implementations require careful handling of storage slots and memory management.

## Development and Testing

To work with this contract:

1. Ensure you have the necessary Ethereum development tools installed (e.g., Hardhat, Truffle, or Foundry).
2. Compile the Yul code to EVM bytecode.
3. Deploy using your preferred method (e.g., Hardhat scripts, Remix IDE).
4. Test thoroughly, including all ERC20 functions and edge cases.

## Gas Efficiency

This Yul implementation aims to be more gas-efficient than standard Solidity implementations. Benchmark and compare gas costs for various operations to standard ERC20 contracts.
